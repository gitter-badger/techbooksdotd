Tech Books Deals of the Day
---------------------------
This is the source code that runs http://techbooksdotd.heroku.com.
It's written in Ruby and runs on Sinatra, using Haml for the views.
It's pretty simple--look at techbooksdotd.rb for all controller logic.

I wrote this to save me from having to check the Apress, Manning, and O'Reilly
sites daily for their book deals.
